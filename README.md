# nx-tw-4

NX monorepo React project configured with modern tailwind 4 integration.

Tailwind is configured directly in the Vite configuration file, following the integration approach recommended in the official Tailwind 4 documentation for the latest version.

Additionally, the project is also working with DaisyUI.

The reason for this is that the current NX generator still uses the old Tailwind setup based on PostCSS, which is now deprecated..
